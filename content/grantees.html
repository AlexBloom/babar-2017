      <p>With a goal of assisting low-income families to obtain safe, affordable and quality housing, Catch the Spirit has built 1 house a year for the past 24 years. Their 2018 project is to build one house for a low-income family using all volunteer labor with the support of monetary and in-kind services, material donations, and grants. Catch the Spirit will use this project to involve and educate the youth and young adults within the Miami Valley area regarding the need for quality affordable housing and how they can help.  Their 2018 house build is anticipated in a new development area in Dayton, Ohio and will be one of several houses being built to complete a new neighborhood, helping to reduce the need for affordable housing in the area.</p>

      <p>Each year, Northwest Indian Housing Association (NWIHA) raises money to support a Youth Scholarship Program that addresses critical gaps in incentivizing, encouraging, and materially supporting Native American youth as they pursue higher education. Because the NWIHA Scholarship Program is conducted by an association of Tribal Housing Authorities, this scholarship is processed through one of their Tribesâ€™ Housing Directors. In this way, their membership is able to connect with candidates on a personal level, hearing their stories and goals and sharing the importance of fighting for affordable Tribal housing at not only the local but the national level. Recipients of this scholarship have continued to volunteer with housing authorities.</p>

      <h3>YouthBuild Louisville</h3>
      <h4 class="caps bold">Louisville, KY</h4>
      <h5 class="h3 bold">$5,196  &mdash; CUS</h5>
      <p> YouthBuild Louisville is an education, job training, and leadership program that provides low-income adults (18-24) opportunities to realize their potential as active leaders and an educated workforce for Louisville. Each year, YBL students build/rehab two affordable housing units, and weatherize 15-20 single-family, low-income homes while completing 32,000 hours of community service. The homes built and rehabbed change the face of challenged neighborhoods making previously vacant houses and lots livable and useful, addressing the community need for affordable housing.  In turn, this addresses the unemployment rate of young adults and the lack of affordable housing in Louisville.  Since 2001, YouthBuild has built and/or rehabbed 19 homes and weatherized 92 homes all over the Louisville community and will continue to grow this number with each program year.</p>
