      <h4 class="h5 caps bold"> SUS17</h4>
      <p>Kelly graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in May with a degree in chemical engineering. After riding with the Southern United States route last summer, she packed up her belongings and moved to Los Angeles as a SolarCorps Project Fellow at GRID Alternatives LA. GRID Alternatives is a nonprofit that works in the United States and internationally to make clean, renewable energy and technology and job training accessible to underserved communities. Kelly works on site to measure, design, permit, and install solar systems for affordable housing units and for homeowners who qualify as low-income. </p>
      <p>Before riding with Bike & Build, Kelly thought she would be looking into engineering jobs as a result of her new engineering degree. However, after this past summer, she was inspired by her teammates to step outside of her immediate comfort zone and take the AmeriCorps position with GRID. </p>

      <blockquote><p>“My teammates were definitely a big influence on my decision to do Americorps.  A few of them had done Americorps or the Peace Corps before Bike & Build, and I was really inspired from hearing their experiences.  But ultimately, I think they influenced me the most by giving me the courage to think outside the box and find a way to work in a field I was passionate about, and a for cause that I believed in.”
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>When asked what one of her favorite days on SUS was, Kelly said their ride into Mosquero, New Mexico. During this ride, they had amazing tailwinds until lunch and then their first big climb of the trip. The whole team kept saying it was “The Best Day Ever,” and this phrase stuck around everyday for the rest of their trip. </p>
      <p>Ultimately, Kelly is inspired to continue working in renewable energy, combining the knowledge she has gained from the University of Pittsburgh, Bike & Build, and GRID Alternatives and applying it to a field she is passionate about. She is committed towards helping families and underserved populations obtain safe, affordable homes and renewable energy, presenting more moments for them to sit back and say this is “the best day ever.”</p>

      <h4 class="h5 caps bold"> NUS17</h4>
      <p>Spenser discovered Bike & Build through a friend that had ridden in 2016 and was immediately hooked. Although he had planned on leading summer backpacking trips post-graduation from University of Wisconsin - La Crosse, Spenser very quickly made the bold decision to join Bike & Build’s Northern United States team this past summer and ride his bike across the country to raise money and awareness for affordable housing. </p>

      <p>When reflecting on his summer with NUS’17, Spenser notes, “The people and the sense of community were my favorite part about Bike & Build because they allow for all of these amazing memories and places to be shared! At 22, I was still on the younger side of the group so it was cool to gain perspectives from some of the older riders and their post-grad careers. It was fun mixing up ride groups every day and naming our different groups or having theme days. Working with people on a build day or riding with a group for a long, tough ride really helped people bond through a tough, yet fulfilling experience.”</p>

      <p>Since graduating in May with a degree in Public Administration, Spenser spent his summer pedaling across the country. Then after dipping his front tire in the Pacific Ocean in early September, he headed off to work as a Teaching Fellow at Alzar School in Cascade, Idaho. Spencer currently balances his time between co-teaching algebra II classes in Idaho and leading backpacking and kayaking expeditions in the Northwestern United States and Patagonia, Chile. </p>

      <p>Spenser’s passions for teaching and adventure are clear through his actions. In June, he is headed to Houston to begin his training for Teach for America-Indianapolis. </p>

      <blockquote><p>“I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to work with students teaching Secondary Math starting later this year while also serving underprivileged communities whom are most affected by the lack of affordable housing. I am thankful for Bike & Build for opening my eyes to many different service opportunities and allowing me to share ideas and goals with so many like-minded, amazing individuals!”</p></blockquote>

      <p>Moving forward, Spenser has aspirations to continue a life of service through food justice and sustainability. More specifically, he is interested in how people’s food choices are impacted by where they live and work. He hopes to start a community garden at the school he is placed at in Indianapolis next year.</p>
