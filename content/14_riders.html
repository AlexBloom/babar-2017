      <h4 class="h5 caps bold"> Capital Ride 2013, Connecticut to California 2016</h4>
      <p>Fresh out of high school, 18 year old Daniel Farmer had his first adventure with Bike &amp; Build on 2013’s Capital Ride. During this 15-day route, Daniel rode from Richmond, VA, to Philadelphia, PA, spending four of those days building affordable homes throughout the Mid-Atlantic part of the country.</p>

      <blockquote><p>“On the Capital Ride, my favorite ride was into DC. It was my first century, which was a big deal,” says Daniel. “Then, as we got into the city, several alumni joined us, which was my first taste of what being in the B&B network means, and how much it would matter to me to join the ranks of B&B alumni.”
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>While 2013 would see the final edition of Bike &amp; Build’s first regional ride, as the Capital Ride paved the way for our current Drift routes, the experience was only the beginning of Daniel’s participation with B&B. In 2016 - 3 years after his journey from Richmond to DC - Daniel returned to B&B as part of the Connecticut to California ride.
      </p>
      <p>Daniel hails from Bike &amp; Build’s home base in the City of Brotherly Love - Philadelphia, PA. After graduating from Central High School and participating in the Capital Ride, Daniel headed to the University of Delaware where he is now finishing his senior year. He is majoring in Environmental Studies, and minoring in Organizational and Community Leadership, as well as Spanish Studies. Daniel’s two B&B trips just scratch the surface of his dedication to service. Since beginning at the University of Delaware, Daniel has been involved with the university’s Alternative Breaks Program, where he serves as the Diversity and Inclusion Co-Chair of the Executive Board. Last spring, Daniel interned at the Newark Bike Project, where he assisted the creation and implementation of a cycling education program called the Youth Empowerment Program.
      </p>
      <p>Come May 2017, Daniel’s commitment to service will take him to new horizons as he will join the Peace Corps to serve as an Environmental Education Volunteer in Mexico.

      <h3 class="bold">Megan Reilly</h3>
      <h4 class="h5 caps bold"> Northern US 2016</h4>
      <p>When Megan applied to be a Bike &amp; Build Trip Leader in 2016, she was living in New York City and needed a change of pace. She had heard about B&B after a friend completed the South Carolina to Santa Cruz trip in 2014, and felt inspired by the physical challenge and fundraising component of the program. </p>
        <blockquote>“When I signed up to be a trip leader it was with the intention of giving back to the communities that we were going to be going through,” says Megan, “but on my own personal note I really wanted to find where I was going to hit my wall.” </blockquote>
      <p>Leading Northern US was the challenge she had been seeking.</p>
      <p>Bike &amp; Build was not Megan’s first long-distance cycling tour, as she previously completed the AIDS/LifeCycle Ride to End AIDS - a weeklong journey from San Francisco to Los Angeles that benefits HIV and AIDS services in those communities. Megan is from LA, and when she heard about the ride from a family friend, she knew she had to be a part of it: “I had a lot of energy and love to give and needed somewhere to put it.” Her experiences on the AIDS/LifeCycle ride, which she describes as “like Burning Man on wheels,” helped prepare her as a leader and cyclist with Bike &amp; Build this past year.
      </p>
      <p>Building community is a common thread that runs through Megan’s passions and what she does. With Bike &amp; Build, Megan and her team served multiple communities as their location and impact changed on a daily basis while they traveled across the country. AIDS LifeCycle provided the opportunity to have a more localized impact and invest in a particular community. After completing Northern this past summer, Megan actually began working for AIDS LifeCycle as a Cycle Rep, where she handles everything from rider management to leading the org’s Women’s Initiative - all while living out her passion for service and helping people.
      </p>
      <p>Megan views her current position to be in many ways an extension of her work for B&B, and a further expression of her dedication to serving others. Speaking to anyone who might be thinking about getting more involved with service work and causes for social justice, Megan says, “My advice to anybody right now, specifically at this moment in time, is: If ever there were a time to be the best version of yourself on behalf of others, it would be now.”
