      <p>Before ordering their bike, riders must pass the League of American Bicyclists TS101 online safety quiz in addition to an extensive Bike &amp; Build specific safety quiz. The B&B safety quiz was completely re-written in 2016 to be more comprehensive and engaging while including notes about the inherent dangers of cycling and address our accident history (topics that will continue to be discussed in both the leader and rider manuals, at orientation, and on the road). Riders must score a 100% on this quiz.</p>

      <p>The 500 mile requirement is tracked via a spreadsheet with which the entire team interacts. Failure to complete training miles pre-trip will lead to expulsion from the trip. In addition, riders must affirm they completed at least one ride in the rain, one ride with a group, and one ride in hilly terrain.</p>

      <p>In addition to safety triangles, riders are issued a daytime-visibility flashing tail light (which was required to be on at all times when riding) in addition to a front flashing light. As an additional element of visual engagement, riders are provided with neon flagging tape to strap to their hydration packs.</p>

      <p>When developing cue sheets, leaders are required to use specific criterion and evaluate their cue sheet using several external resources. Once the cue sheet is complete, a second leader will review it; then that leader’s mentor (someone who has been a leader within the past two years) will review it. If there are still concerns, a staff member will review the cue sheet. Staff also randomly reviews cue sheets.</p>

      <p>Over the course of the trip, every rider is required to spend 2+ days in the van serving as the “Safety Navigator”. This person assists our support vehicle drivers, ensuring they are not distracted by phone calls, navigation issues, etc. The Safety Navigator also notes riding habits and safety practices as the vehicle approaches and passes riders, takes general notes about the cue sheet for future record, assists with lunch set up/ clean up, answers phone calls, and other potential responsibilities relative to that day (grocery store runs, rider pick-ups, etc).</p>
