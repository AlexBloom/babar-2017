      <p>North Shore CDC’s YouthBuild program prepares youth for workplace success in construction while also supporting leadership development and civic engagement. YouthBuild students build affordable housing in their communities, while completing the HiSet program to obtain a GED. With the 2016 grant from Bike &amp; Build’s Coastal Drift trip, North Shore CDC will support two green certification trainings for YouthBuild participants - weatherization and green construction - providing advanced training and expertise in a growing employment sector.

        “Our YouthBuild students are supported by Bike &amp; Build financially and through volunteerism. Each year, your grant allows our students to further their education through construction certifications or providing a teaching opportunity such as guest speakers coming to their classes or site visits to colleges. Bike &amp; Build allows us the opportunity to complete more build day projects by attending one of these events and shows our students the joy that can come from volunteerism.”

      <p>YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School is a diploma and job training program for high school dropouts. The school’s primary objective is to provide training in construction through a hands-on, service-oriented approach that engages students in rehabilitating homes. This allows for a dualistic approach for the students to rebuild their community while rebuilding their lives.
      </p><p>Bike &amp; Build’s grant will support YouthBuild’s construction training and housing renovation program. This program alternates between the classroom and worksites, where 60 young adults will be involved in this hands-on construction, safety, carpentry, tool use, project management, and professional communication training.

        “It’s exciting to work with Bike &amp; Build, because they share our interest in affordable housing and are similarly engaged in building the next generation of housing and community advocates. Additionally, it’s very exciting to work with a national organization that’s headquartered in Philadelphia! We feel very connected to a broader network of housing organizations and have met some really wonderful members of the Bike &amp; Build community through this partnership.”

        Tahlequah Area Habitat for Humanity works to provide safe and affordable homes in Cherokee County, Oklahoma. With their grant award from the 2016 Southern US group, Tahlequah Area HFH will purchase lumber to build Habitat House 24 for a low-income woman with a disability. For the project, they will engage college students from Northeastern State University (NSU), Indian Capital Technical Center (ICTC), and Talking Leaves Job Corps (TLJC) in a Build and Learn Work Spring Break project. Students will build walls, install electrical wiring, and do landscape work on Habitat House 24 under the supervision of local professionals. Young people who participate in the building process learn valuable skills and gain a powerful perspective working alongside first-time homeowners.
