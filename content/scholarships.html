  <p>In 2017, Bike & Build continued to grow our Scholarship Program, offering three full cross-country scholarships and three partial scholarships to six recipients. </p>
  <p>These scholarships were made possible thanks to the families, friends, and committee members of the Chris Webber Memorial Scholarship, Patrick Zuza Scholarship, and Margaret Lowe Scholarship, as well as the Bike & Build Alumni Council. We are grateful for their ongoing commitment to our Scholarship Program and recipients.</p>
  <p>In 2018 we aim to continue this growth by awarding seven scholarships.</p>

Being surrounded by 34 unique people who have such different experiences and perspectives challenged me to think it new ways everyday.  Meeting people in communities who were so insanely generous to us made me think about kindness and humanity all the time and learning the stories of people who we built with reinforced my passion to work in public interest.  On top of that, the people on my trip were so incredibly supportive and completely spun my outlook on life on everything from how lucky I am to how I can change the world to how to have fun in any situation.” </p>
