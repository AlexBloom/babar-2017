    <div class="">
      <p>With 15 years on the road, we would like to once again thank our alumni, donors, hosts, build partners, and members of the community for all of your support over the past decade and a half. Without your backing, Bike & Build’s impact on the affordable housing cause thus far would be unimaginable. </p>

      <p>In 2002, Bike & Build was founded on just one person’s vision. 15 years later, Bike & Build has grown to an alumni base of over 3,500 young adults who have spent 236,000 hours building affordable homes, and funded $6.4 million to grant to affordable housing organizations across the country. </p>

      <p>While these metrics provide an overview of what we have accomplished in the past 15 years, we must also recognize the equally important impact of individual growth and leadership development that our riders and leaders encounter on the road. We are proud of the hard work and dedication our alumni have to their teams, the cause, and the continuation of service-oriented work post-summer with Bike & Build. </p>

      <p>2017 was a year of transition at Bike & Build. We welcomed three new full time staff members while saying farewell to three others, leading us to scale back on the number of routes in order to maintain our emphasis on high quality experiences on our trips. In 2017, our teams rode the Northern, Central, and Southern United States cross-country routes, as well as our Coastal Drift and Drift West regional routes. In addition to these five routes, we partnered with the Travis Manion Foundation to organize a ride for veterans from Pittsburgh to Washington, DC. </p>

      <p>This year we celebrated our history and accomplishments of the past 15 years with an alumni event in Triangle, Virginia. Over 100 alumni were present from trips ranging from 2007 to 2017, who came together to reflect on their experiences, collectively think about Bike & Build's future, and volunteer at 5 different service projects in the Washington D.C. area.</p>

      <p>Moving into 2018, we are excited to announce the inaugural Keys to Canada route - a 2,900 mile ride from the Florida Keys up to the northern border of Maine. This route will be guided by the East Coast Greenway, stopping to build affordable homes along the Eastern Seaboard.</p>

      <p>Once again, thank you to everyone who has accompanied us for the past 15 years. Without our riders, leaders, hosts, donors, and partners, we simply could not be where we are today.</p>

      <p>Cheers to the next 15,</p>
