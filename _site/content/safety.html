      <p>Before ordering their bike, riders must pass the League of American Bicyclists TS101 online safety quiz in addition to an extensive Bike & Build specific safety quiz. Riders’ completion of both quizzes ensures that they are well educated in safe and legal cycling behavior as well as Bike & Build-specific policies and history prior to their arrival at orientation.</p>

      <p>The 500 mile requirement is tracked via a spreadsheet with which the entire team interacts. Failure to complete training miles pre-trip will lead to expulsion from the trip. In addition, riders must affirm they completed at least one ride longer than 65 miles, one ride in the rain, one ride with a group, and one ride in hilly terrain.</p>

      <p>In addition to safety triangles, riders are issued daytime-visibility flashing front and rear lights which are required to be on at all times while riding.</p>

      <p>When developing cue sheets, leaders are required to use specific criterion and evaluate their cue sheet using several external resources. Once the cue sheet is complete, a second leader will review it; then that leader’s mentor (someone who has been a leader within the past two years) will review it. If there are still concerns, a staff member will review the cue sheet. Staff also randomly reviews cue sheets.</p>

      <p>Over the course of the trip, every rider is required to spend 2+ days in the van serving as the “Safety Navigator”. This person assists our support vehicle drivers, ensuring they are not distracted by phone calls, navigation issues, etc. The Safety Navigator also notes riding habits and safety practices as the vehicle approaches and passes riders, takes general notes about the cue sheet for future record, assists with lunch set up/ clean up, answers phone calls, and other potential responsibilities relative to that day (grocery store runs, rider pick-ups, etc).</p>

      <p>While in the van, Safety Navigators contact local media and police before riding into each town. Mandatory and structured opportunities for dialogue and feedback on the route and safety practices are incorporated into on-the-road schedules.</p>

      <p>As an additional element of visual engagement, riders are provided with high visibility reflective ankle straps to highlight moving parts of their bodies and make them more recognizable to other road users.</p>

      <p>We require that all riders train with and have a mirror on their bikes at all times throughout the duration of their Bike & Build trip. We instruct our riders to make a habit of turning around constantly to observe what is behind them; mirrors allow additional vigilance to monitor any approaching vehicles or cyclists.</p>

      <p>We utilize a two-van on-the-road support system. Leaders, along with a Safety Navigator, drive the van and trailer directly to the overnight location and observe the route in the morning before riders begin their day; this allows them to identify potential hazards or road closures and adjust the route as necessary. After dropping the trailer off at the host, they circle back and provide additional support as needed. Although not acting as a chase vehicle directly behind riders, each van is outfitted with high visibility signage encouraging other road users to watch out for cyclists on the road. The second van, driven by a rider with a Safety Navigator, carries lunch and is available to riders as needed while also acting as a billboard to other road users. All Bike & Build 15-passenger van drivers are trained before the trip start.</p>
